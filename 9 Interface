# Interface is like a contract between two part of you application.

	1: inside interface we can define our abstract method
	ex: void name();  (all abstract methods are public)

# Using interface in class:

	1: public className implements interfaceName{}
	2: overright interface methods.

# instantiating in Main Class:

	1: InterfaceName naming = new ClassName();
		(the class where to implements interface.)
		(Assaining class to an interface)
	2:ex:
	    List <String> studentName = new Arraylist<>();
	( List <E> ==> E means any kind of objects.)


# Use of interface:
	# interface is a contract between different part of your application
	# cllback interface == click listener.
	# communication between two different threads.
	# implements multiple interfaces in the decoration of you class
		( public class className implement firstInterface, secondInterface{} )
