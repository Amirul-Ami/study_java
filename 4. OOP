1# inheritance == extends ClassName {constractor}
	Ex:
	1: public Class Dog extends Animal{}
	2: public Class Shephard extends Dog{}


2# Polymorphism = having multiple forms.
	1: many constructor with same name
	2: many method whith same name:	fly();  fly(int Speed);
	2: Override methd (different forms: doing different job in different class.)

3# Composition in OOP:

  # Using classes in other classes
	ex:
	private class Car{
		private Engine engine;
		public Car(Engine engine) {this.engine = engine}
		
	private Class Main{
	Car Name = new Car( new Engine("value") )

4# Null == nothing

5# final == will not change the value
	1: final variable
	2: final class
